## 🌐 About Me
I'm Lynxist and I started out as a vehicle developer for FiveM (Model related aswell as tuning). I turned to 3D modelling as it's more interesting and started to make MLO's, Shells and props. I've started to pick up on Lua, HTML, CSS and some JS while working on my current project.

I do have a bunch more script ideas that will be implemented in to our own server and most likely will be released on GitHub aswell.
